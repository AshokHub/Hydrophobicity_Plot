# Hydrophobicity Plot
### _Using Python/BioPython/Google Colab_

This is a simple Hydrophobicity plot program using Python/BioPython.

- Method 1 - Using BioPython and FASTA input file
- Method 2 - Using BioPython and FASTA sequence
- Method 3 - Using Python and raw sequence

The sample output using *Method 3* is below,

## Demo

The interactive demo of the three methods using Google Colab are below:

- [Method 1](https://github.com/AshokHub/Hydrophobicity_Plot/blob/main/Hydrophobicity_Plot.ipynb) - Parses FASTA file to get sequence id and sequence
- [Method 2](https://github.com/AshokHub/Hydrophobicity_Plot/blob/main/Hydrophobicity_Plot_1.ipynb) - Parses FASTA string to get sequence id and sequence
- [Method 3](https://github.com/AshokHub/Hydrophobicity_Plot/blob/main/Hydrophobicity_Plot_2.ipynb) - Use raw sequence only

And of course all programs are open source with a [public repository][AshokHub] on GitHub.
